# picocms-theme-identity
This is a modification of the [HTML5UP Identity Template](https://github.com/html5up/identity) to work with [Pico CMS](https://github.com/picocms/Pico). It uses [Font-Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) for the Social Icons.

You should also have a look at the original [README](README.txt).
